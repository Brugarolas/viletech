--- @meta

--- An entity is represented in Lua by a table with userdata for native ECS
--- components alongside fields defined in the blueprint. Attempting to re-assign
--- any of the fields below (e.g `id = 'hello world'`) will result in an error.
--- @class entity
--- This entity's universally-unique identifier. Assigned on creation and immutable.
--- @field id integer
--- @field special ecs.special?

--- Primarily for use by ACS behaviours. An entity won't have this component unless
--- the map specifies one of the fields within, or it gets added at runtime.
--- @class ecs.special
--- "Thing ID".
--- Universally-unique identifier for this entity, separate from its ECS ID,
--- primarily for use by ACS. Unlike the ECS ID, this is always mutable.

--- @field int1 integer
--- Corresponds to ZScript's `Actor::special2`.
--- @field int2 integer
--- Corresponds to ZScript's `Actor::specialf1`.
--- @field float1 number
--- Corresponds to ZScript's `Actor::specialf2`.
