# VZScript

## About

The VZSC toolchain; VileTech's fork of the [ZScript](https://zdoom.org/wiki/ZScript) programming language used by GZDoom and Raze, designed for being transpiled to from ZScript (and its predecessors), while not compromising on versatility as a game script, as ZScript did.

[The rationale document](../docs/vzs-rationale.md) covers the reasons why VileTech opts to introduce such a fork, as well as the other reasons for VZScript's design decisions.
