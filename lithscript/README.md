# LithScript

## About

The LSCC toolchain; VileTech's answer to the [ZScript](https://zdoom.org/wiki/ZScript) programming language used by GZDoom and Raze, designed for being transpiled to from ZScript and other ZDoom languages, while not compromising on versatility as a game script, as ZScript did.

[The rationale document](../docs/lith-rationale.md) covers the reasons why VileTech opts to introduce such a language, as well as the other reasons for LithScript's design decisions.

## Feature Flags

`viletech` - Adds functions geared towards serving the VileTech Engine's specific needs, i.e. transpilation from the languages of other source ports.
